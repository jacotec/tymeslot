defmodule TymeslotWeb.Themes.Shared.BookingText do
  @moduledoc """
  Resolves the booking page's introductory copy: the organiser's own wording
  when they have turned the customisation on, the theme's translated default
  otherwise.

  Every theme with an overview step renders the same three slots, so the
  resolution lives here rather than in each theme. The heading default differs
  by theme (Quill opens with a generic greeting, Rhythm names the organiser)
  and is therefore keyed by theme; the greeting and instruction defaults are
  identical everywhere.

  The defaults live here rather than inline in each theme because the dashboard
  has to show an organiser what a single custom heading replaces in *both*
  themes, which is cross-theme knowledge no individual theme may hold. Themes
  still own the name they introduce themselves by, and pass it in: Rhythm
  substitutes a friendly word when the profile has no name, Quill drops the
  greeting instead.

  The stored wording is a single string, not a per-locale map, matching the
  meeting type names and descriptions rendered directly beneath it on the same
  screen. Turning the customisation on therefore opts these three strings out of
  translation, which is the same trade the rest of the organiser's copy already
  makes.
