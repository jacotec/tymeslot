  Orchestrates account deletion.

  Runs the external-cleanup hook (e.g. SaaS subscription cancellation) before
  any DB change and, once that succeeds, runs the cross-domain
  anonymise-then-delete transaction spanning `Auth` and `MeetingPayments`,
  then removes the files the deleted rows pointed at.

  @doc """
  Deletes a user.

  Runs the configured `:account_deletion_hook` first; if it fails, the
  deletion is aborted and the user, along with all their data, is left
  intact. We never destroy a user while external state that keeps costing
  them money (an active subscription) could not be cancelled.

  On success, runs `Tymeslot.MeetingPayments.anonymise_host/1` before the
  delete so booking-payment and payment-transaction rows are scrubbed and
  marked retained. The ordering is what guarantees survival: anonymisation
  nils the host reference on each row (`booking_payments.host_user_id` is a
  bare integer with no FK; `payment_transactions.user_id` is set to nil)
  before the user row is deleted, so no retained row still points at the
  user when the delete runs — regardless of the FK's `on_delete`. Both must
  happen in the same transaction. Required for tax-record retention under EU
  and Swiss commercial law (GDPR Art. 17(3)(b) carve-out).

  Once the transaction commits, every live socket bound to one of the user's
  sessions is disconnected: the cascade removes the session rows, but a
  connected LiveView socket never re-reads them.

  Then the profile's uploaded avatars and theme
  backgrounds are removed from disk. The database cascade deletes only rows,
  and an avatar is usually a photo of the person, so leaving the files would
  keep personal data past an erasure request. Files go only after the commit:
  a rolled-back deletion must not leave live rows pointing at missing files.
  A file that cannot be removed is logged and does not fail the deletion,
  which has already happened.
