# Tymeslot - Docker Deployment Guide

**Enterprise-grade meeting scheduling platform built with Elixir/Phoenix LiveView**

> For a comprehensive overview of Tymeslot's features and capabilities, see the [Core README](README.md).

## Overview

Deploy Tymeslot using Docker with an embedded PostgreSQL database. This provides:

- **Single container** with embedded PostgreSQL
- **Volume persistence** for data and uploads
- **Easy deployment** on any Docker-compatible platform

---

## System Requirements

- **Docker** (version 20.10+ recommended)
- **500MB RAM** minimum (1GB recommended)
- **Domain name** (optional, for production use)

---

## Quick start

There are two ways to run Tymeslot, and both start a single self-contained container with PostgreSQL embedded:

- **Option A — prebuilt image:** the fastest way to get going.
- **Option B — build from source:** use Docker Compose to build and pin your own image.

> 📖 For the complete, always-current configuration reference — every environment variable, plus SMTP, Postmark, OAuth/OIDC, reverse proxy, and backups — see the online docs at **<https://tymeslot.app/docs>**. This README is the self-contained quick path; the sections below link to the matching online articles.

### Option A — Run the prebuilt image (fastest)

Pull and run the published image directly:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name tymeslot \
  -p 4000:4000 \
  -e SECRET_KEY_BASE="$(openssl rand -base64 64 | tr -d '\n')" \
  -e PHX_HOST=localhost \
  -e EMAIL_ADAPTER=smtp \
  -e EMAIL_FROM_NAME="Tymeslot" \
  -e EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="noreply@yourdomain.com" \
  -e SMTP_HOST="smtp.example.com" \
  -e SMTP_PORT=587 \
  -e SMTP_USERNAME="your-smtp-username" \
  -e SMTP_PASSWORD="your-smtp-password" \
  -v tymeslot_data:/app/data \
  -v tymeslot_pg:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  luka1thb/tymeslot:latest
```

A long `-e` list gets unwieldy. Compose reads a `.env` next to it (see below), and `docker run` has two alternatives: `--env-file ./my-env` on the host, or a `.env` file inside the `/app/data` volume, which the app reads at boot and which survives image updates because the volume does. Values passed with `-e` or `--env-file` win over that file, so it works as the defaults layer under one-off overrides. Five keys are the exception and are ignored in that file with a warning at boot: `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_DB`, `DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_HOST` and `DATABASE_PORT`. They decide which database the container uses and which role the embedded cluster is created with, so they are container settings (`-e`, `--env-file` or Compose), and earlier releases never read them from that file, so a stale copy left there would otherwise point an upgraded install at an empty database or an unreachable host. `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is honoured, and the embedded cluster's role is brought in line with it on every start. Copy [`.env.example`](.env.example) as your starting point; it documents every variable.

This will pull the image automatically if it is not present locally. For a pinned version, replace `latest` with a release tag — `luka1thb/tymeslot:<VERSION>`, substituting the version number you want. The full list of published tags is on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/luka1thb/tymeslot/tags).

**Prefer Compose?** The repository's `docker-compose.yml` runs the same published image and needs no clone. Download it next to your `.env` and start:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tymeslot/tymeslot/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tymeslot/tymeslot/main/.env.example
# edit .env, then:
docker compose up -d
```

The embedded PostgreSQL listens only on `localhost` inside the container and is never exposed, so its password is an internal detail — if you omit `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` it defaults to `tymeslot`, which is fine for the embedded database. Set a strong `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` when you point Tymeslot at an [external database](#using-an-external-database).

> **Keep `tymeslot_pg:/var/lib/postgresql/data` as a named volume.** Swapping it for a host path (e.g. `./pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data`) can break first-run initialization on Docker Desktop, rootless Docker, userns-remap, or SELinux-enforcing hosts because the mount arrives with ownership the container can't change. If you need the database on a specific host path, use an [external PostgreSQL](#using-an-external-database) instead.

> ⚠️ **Email defaults to silent discard.** Without email configuration, `EMAIL_ADAPTER` defaults to `test`, which **drops every message** — password resets, booking confirmations and reminders all vanish with no error. Configure SMTP, Postmark, SendGrid, Mailgun or AhaSend (below) before going live. See **<https://tymeslot.app/docs/email-smtp>** and **<https://tymeslot.app/docs/email-postmark>**.

### Option B — Build from source (Docker Compose)

Build the image yourself instead of pulling the published one. Docker builds
straight from the repository URL, so cloning is only necessary if you want to
modify the source.

#### 1. Get the source

**Without cloning (quickest).** Create an empty directory and put this
`compose.yaml` in it. Docker does the checkout itself as part of the build:

```yaml
services:
  tymeslot:
    build:
      # Docker clones the repository itself. The fragment after `#` selects
      # which branch or tag to build.
      context: https://github.com/Tymeslot/tymeslot.git#${TYMESLOT_VERSION:-main}
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.docker
    image: tymeslot:${TYMESLOT_VERSION:-main}
    container_name: tymeslot
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "${PORT:-4000}:${PORT:-4000}"
    # Forward every variable from .env into the container, so SMTP, OAuth and
    # DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY settings reach Tymeslot as well.
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      DEPLOYMENT_TYPE: docker
      # Same value .env already supplies. It is repeated here only so Compose
      # refuses to start with this message rather than booting a broken
      # container when the secret is missing.
      SECRET_KEY_BASE: "${SECRET_KEY_BASE:?required, generate one with: openssl rand -base64 64}"
    volumes:
      - tymeslot_data:/app/data
      - tymeslot_pg:/var/lib/postgresql/data

# Volume names are pinned with `name:` so they match the `docker run`
# quick-start above instead of being prefixed with the Compose project name.
volumes:
  tymeslot_data:
    name: tymeslot_data
  tymeslot_pg:
    name: tymeslot_pg

networks:
  default:
    name: tymeslot_network
```

`TYMESLOT_VERSION` decides what gets built. Leave it unset to track `main`, or
set it in `.env` to a release tag for a reproducible build:

```bash
TYMESLOT_VERSION=v1.4.4
```

The published tags are listed on the [releases page](https://github.com/Tymeslot/tymeslot/releases).
Building from a git URL needs BuildKit, which is the default from Docker 23.0
onwards.

**With a clone.** Take this path if you intend to modify the source, or to use
the build script and the repository's own `docker-compose.build.yml`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tymeslot/tymeslot.git
cd tymeslot
```

#### 2. Configure Environment

Both paths read the same `.env` file, sitting next to your Compose file.

```bash
# Start from the environment template
cp .env.example .env                # in a clone
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tymeslot/tymeslot/main/.env.example   # without one

# Generate required secrets
openssl rand -base64 64 | tr -d '\n'  # For SECRET_KEY_BASE
openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -d '\n'  # For POSTGRES_PASSWORD

# Edit .env and fill in the required values
nano .env
```

**Required Configuration** (`.env` file):

```bash
# REQUIRED: Must be at least 64 characters
SECRET_KEY_BASE=<paste_generated_secret>

# REQUIRED: Your domain (or "localhost" for testing)
PHX_HOST=localhost

# REQUIRED: Database credentials
POSTGRES_DB=tymeslot
POSTGRES_USER=tymeslot
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<paste_generated_password>

# OPTIONAL: Port (defaults to 4000)
PORT=4000
```

#### 3. Build and run

**Method 1 — Docker Compose (recommended, works for both paths):**

```bash
docker compose up -d --build                              # your own compose.yaml, no clone
docker compose -f docker-compose.build.yml up -d --build  # in a clone
```

In a clone, pass `-f docker-compose.build.yml` explicitly. The default
`docker-compose.yml` pulls the published image rather than building one, which
is Option A above.

Compose reads your `.env`, builds the image, and starts the container with the `tymeslot_data` and `tymeslot_pg` volumes. It reads `.env` twice over: once to fill in the `${...}` placeholders in the Compose file, and once through `env_file` to forward every variable into the container. The second part is what carries your SMTP, OAuth and `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` settings through, so keep `env_file` in place if you adapt the file.

To move to a newer release later, set the new tag and rebuild:

```bash
TYMESLOT_VERSION=v1.5.0 docker compose up -d --build
```

(In a clone, `git pull` first and rebuild with
`docker compose -f docker-compose.build.yml up -d --build`; the build context is
your working tree, so `TYMESLOT_VERSION` has no effect there.)

**Method 2 — Build script (clone only):**

```bash
# Run from the repository root
./build-docker.sh
```

The script validates your `.env`, builds the image, and offers to start the container.

**Method 3 — Manual Docker commands (clone only):**

```bash
# Build image
docker build -f Dockerfile.docker -t tymeslot:local .

# Run container
source .env
docker run -d \
  --name tymeslot \
  -p ${PORT:-4000}:${PORT:-4000} \
  --env-file .env \
  -v tymeslot_data:/app/data \
  -v tymeslot_pg:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  tymeslot:local
```

#### 4. Access Your Installation

Wait 30-60 seconds for initialization, then visit:

- **URL**: `http://localhost:4000`

For production deployment with SSL/HTTPS, configure your reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy, Traefik, etc.) separately — see the [Reverse Proxy Setup](https://tymeslot.app/docs/reverse-proxy) guide for full Nginx and Caddy walkthroughs.

### 5. Becoming an admin

The first user to register on a fresh install is automatically promoted to admin. To promote additional users (or recover if no admin exists), use the release helper from inside the container:

```bash
docker exec -it tymeslot bin/tymeslot rpc 'Tymeslot.Release.promote_admin("you@example.com")'
```

See [`docs/ADMIN.md`](docs/ADMIN.md) for the full guide (demote, list, recovery paths).

## Understanding the Deployment Scripts

Tymeslot uses two scripts for Docker deployment:

### build-docker.sh (Host Machine)

Runs on your host machine to prepare and build the Docker image.

**Responsibilities**:
- Validates `.env` file exists
- Validates required environment variables
- Checks SECRET_KEY_BASE meets security requirements (64+ characters)
- Builds Docker image
- Optionally starts the container

**Usage**:
```bash
./build-docker.sh
```

### start-docker.sh (Container Entrypoint)

Runs automatically inside the container when it starts.

**Responsibilities**:
- Initializes PostgreSQL database (first run only)
- Starts PostgreSQL service
- Creates database and user
- Runs database migrations
- Starts Phoenix web server

**Note**: This script runs automatically - you never call it directly.

---

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
SECRET_KEY_BASE=<64+ characters>    # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 64 | tr -d '\n'
PHX_HOST=<your-domain-or-localhost>
POSTGRES_DB=tymeslot
POSTGRES_USER=tymeslot
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<secure-password> # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -d '\n'
```

### Essential for Production

Email configuration is **required for production deployments** to enable:
- Password reset emails
- Booking confirmations and reminders
- Calendar event notifications
- User invitations

`EMAIL_ADAPTER` picks how mail leaves the container. Every option below is equally supported; the API adapters differ from SMTP mainly in reporting failures usefully and in not needing an outbound SMTP port.

| `EMAIL_ADAPTER` | Additional variables |
|---|---|
| `smtp` | `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT` (default 587), `SMTP_USERNAME` and `SMTP_PASSWORD` (leave both unset for a relay that needs no login), optional `SMTP_SSL`, and for a self-hosted relay `SMTP_CACERTFILE` or `SMTP_TLS_VERIFY` (see below) |
| `postmark` | `POSTMARK_API_KEY` |
| `sendgrid` | `SENDGRID_API_KEY` |
| `mailgun` | `MAILGUN_API_KEY`, `MAILGUN_DOMAIN`, optional `MAILGUN_BASE_URL` for EU accounts |
| `ahasend` | `AHASEND_API_KEY`, `AHASEND_ACCOUNT_ID` |
| `test` | none — every message is discarded |

Any provider not listed works over `smtp`; point `SMTP_HOST` at the relay it gives you. An `EMAIL_ADAPTER` value Tymeslot does not recognise stops the container at boot instead of silently discarding mail.

**Option 1: SMTP (works with every provider)**
```bash
EMAIL_ADAPTER=smtp
EMAIL_FROM_NAME="Your Company"
EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@yourdomain.com
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your-smtp-username
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-smtp-password
```

Port 587 (STARTTLS) and port 465 (implicit TLS) are both supported; any other port negotiates TLS opportunistically. A provider that serves implicit TLS on another port (2465, 8465) needs `SMTP_SSL=true`; without it the connection hangs waiting for a greeting. A relay that authorises by network rather than by login (a local Postfix, a company relay) needs no `SMTP_USERNAME` or `SMTP_PASSWORD`; set both or neither. The certificate is verified against the system trust store, which is what you want for a commercial relay but usually fails against your own mail server: Stalwart, Mailcow and Mailu all serve a self-signed certificate until you point them at Let's Encrypt.

Two variables cover that case. Prefer the first, which keeps the connection authenticated:

```bash
# Trust the CA that issued your relay's certificate (a PEM bundle you mount
# into the container).
SMTP_CACERTFILE=/app/data/smtp-ca.pem

# Last resort: accept any certificate. Mail is still encrypted, but the
# relay's identity is no longer checked, so an intercepted connection cannot
# be detected.
SMTP_TLS_VERIFY=none
```

Rarely, a firewall or proxy between the container and the relay drops a TLS 1.3 handshake because it does not look like TLS 1.2. The symptom is a connection that times out or closes during the handshake while the same relay works from other mail clients; `SMTP_TLS_MIDDLEBOX_COMPAT=true` restores the TLS 1.2 shape. Leave it off otherwise: relays that do not expect it abort every handshake, and the health check at boot says so explicitly when they do.

**Option 2: a provider API (clearer delivery errors, no SMTP port needed)**
```bash
EMAIL_ADAPTER=postmark
EMAIL_FROM_NAME="Your Company"
EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@yourdomain.com
POSTMARK_API_KEY=your-postmark-api-key
```

Swap in `sendgrid`, `mailgun` or `ahasend` with the variables from the table above. Whichever you choose, Tymeslot validates the credentials once at startup (without sending anything) and logs the result, so a bad key shows up in the container logs immediately rather than on the first booking.

**Development/Testing Only**: You can use `EMAIL_ADAPTER=test` to skip email configuration during development. Emails will be logged to console instead of being sent.

### HTTP Proxy Configuration

> Full details, including whitelist domains and troubleshooting: [HTTP Proxy](https://tymeslot.app/docs/http-proxy).

If your environment requires outbound HTTP requests to go through a proxy (common in corporate/secured environments), Tymeslot supports standard proxy environment variables:

**Standard Configuration (Recommended)**
```bash
# For HTTPS requests (most external APIs)
HTTPS_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy.example.com:3128

# For HTTP requests (if different from HTTPS)
HTTP_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy.example.com:3128

# Bypass proxy for specific hosts (comma-separated)
NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,*.internal.company.com,10.0.0.0/8
```

**Environment Variable Details:**
- `HTTPS_PROXY` / `https_proxy` - Proxy for HTTPS requests (recommended)
- `HTTP_PROXY` / `http_proxy` - Proxy for HTTP requests
- `NO_PROXY` / `no_proxy` - Comma-separated list of hosts/patterns to bypass proxy

**NO_PROXY Patterns:**
- Exact hostname: `internal.example.com`
- Wildcard domain: `*.example.com` (matches any subdomain)
- CIDR notation: `10.0.0.0/8`, `192.168.0.0/16`
- Special: `*` (bypass proxy for all hosts)

**Example Configurations:**

Same proxy for HTTP and HTTPS:
```bash
HTTPS_PROXY=http://user:pass@proxy.company.com:3128
NO_PROXY=localhost,*.internal.company.com
```

Different proxies for HTTP and HTTPS:
```bash
HTTP_PROXY=http://user:pass@http-proxy.company.com:3128
HTTPS_PROXY=http://user:pass@https-proxy.company.com:3129
NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,10.0.0.0/8
```

No authentication:
```bash
HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.company.com:8080
NO_PROXY=localhost,*.internal.company.com
```

**What Uses the Proxy:**

All outbound HTTP/HTTPS requests including:
- CalDAV calendar integrations (Nextcloud, Radicale, etc.)
- Google Calendar API
- Microsoft Outlook/Office 365 API
- Video provider APIs (Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Nextcloud Talk)
- Reachability tests for self-hosted meeting servers (MiroTalk, Jitsi Meet, kMeet, custom links)
- OAuth token exchanges
- All other external API calls

**Important**: If your proxy uses a whitelist-based access control, ensure the following domains are allowed:
- `www.googleapis.com` (Google Calendar, Google Meet)
- `graph.microsoft.com` (Outlook Calendar, Microsoft Teams)
- `oauth2.googleapis.com` (OAuth)
- Your CalDAV server domains
- `kmeet.infomaniak.com` (kMeet)
- Your own meeting server domains (MiroTalk, Jitsi Meet, Nextcloud Talk)
- Any custom video provider endpoints

### Using an External Database

Tymeslot's default image bundles PostgreSQL for a one-command start, but nothing requires you to use it. Point it at any PostgreSQL 14 or newer: another container, another host, or a managed service.

**With a connection string** (what managed providers hand you):

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@db.example.com:5432/tymeslot
DATABASE_SSL=true
```

**With discrete variables:**

```bash
DATABASE_HOST=db.example.com
DATABASE_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DB=tymeslot
POSTGRES_USER=tymeslot
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DATABASE_SSL=true
```

`DATABASE_URL` wins where the two overlap, so there is no need to set both.

**Important**: When using an external database:
- The database and user must already exist; Tymeslot creates neither.
- The database must accept connections from your container's network, and firewall rules must allow it.
- Migrations run automatically on every start, so the user needs schema privileges on that database.

**TLS.** Set `DATABASE_SSL=true` for managed databases. It verifies the server certificate and hostname against the system trust store. If your provider uses a private CA, download its bundle onto the `/app/data` volume and set `DATABASE_SSL_CACERT_FILE=/app/data/your-ca.pem`. For a self-signed certificate on a network you already trust, `DATABASE_SSL=verify-none` encrypts the connection without verifying it. Omit the variable entirely for a database on the same host or a private Docker network.

An `sslmode` query parameter in `DATABASE_URL` (as issued by most managed providers) is honoured when `DATABASE_SSL` is unset: `require` encrypts without verification, matching its libpq meaning, while `verify-ca` and `verify-full` verify the certificate like `DATABASE_SSL=true`. An explicit `DATABASE_SSL` always wins over the URL parameter.

**Detection.** The container switches to external mode when `DATABASE_URL` names a remote host, or when `DATABASE_HOST` is anything other than `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`. In external mode it never initialises or starts the bundled PostgreSQL.

A `DATABASE_URL` pointing at `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or `::1` is treated as the bundled database on images that ship one: the container logs a warning, ignores the variable, and connects with the discrete `POSTGRES_*` credentials the bundled cluster is created with. The slim image bundles no server, so there a local URL is honoured as given and expected to reach a PostgreSQL you run yourself.

**Upgrading from 1.4.4 or earlier.** Those releases ignored `DATABASE_URL` on this image and always used the bundled PostgreSQL. If you have a `DATABASE_URL` left over from another deployment and want to keep using the bundled database, remove it before upgrading, or confirm it points at `localhost` so the guard above applies. A `DATABASE_URL` naming a remote host now takes effect and the bundled PostgreSQL is left unused.

### Running PostgreSQL as its own container

If you would rather keep the database separate, for independent backups, an existing backup routine, or plain separation of concerns, use the dedicated Compose file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# fill in SECRET_KEY_BASE, PHX_HOST and POSTGRES_PASSWORD
docker compose -f docker-compose.with-postgres.yml up -d
```

This runs two containers: `tymeslot` (using the slim image described below) and `tymeslot-postgres` (`postgres:17-alpine`), with the app waiting on the database's health check before it starts. The database lives in its own `tymeslot_pgdata` volume, so `docker exec tymeslot-postgres pg_dump …` is all a backup takes.

To use a database you already run elsewhere, delete the `postgres` service and the `depends_on` block from that file and set `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env`.

That file pulls the published slim image. To run one you built yourself, build the slim target from a clone and point `TYMESLOT_IMAGE` at it:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.docker --target release-slim -t tymeslot:local-slim .
echo 'TYMESLOT_IMAGE=tymeslot:local-slim' >> .env
docker compose -f docker-compose.with-postgres.yml up -d
```

### The slim image

`luka1thb/tymeslot:slim` (and `luka1thb/tymeslot:X.Y.Z-slim`) is the same application without the bundled PostgreSQL server: 1.05 GB against 1.22 GB, so roughly 170 MB smaller. It requires an external database and exits immediately with instructions if none is configured.

```bash
docker run -d --name tymeslot \
  -p 4000:4000 \
  -e SECRET_KEY_BASE=... \
  -e PHX_HOST=tymeslot.example.com \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@db.example.com:5432/tymeslot \
  -e DATABASE_SSL=true \
  -v tymeslot_data:/app/data \
  luka1thb/tymeslot:slim
```

**Migrating from the bundled database to an external one:**

```bash
# 1. Dump from the running container's embedded database
docker exec tymeslot su - postgres -c "pg_dump -Fc tymeslot" > tymeslot.dump

# 2. Restore into the new database
pg_restore -d "postgres://user:password@db.example.com:5432/tymeslot" tymeslot.dump

# 3. Add DATABASE_URL to your .env, switch the image tag to :slim, and recreate
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

Keep `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (and `SECRET_KEY_BASE`, if you never set a separate encryption key) identical across the move, or stored credentials become undecryptable.

### Podman

Everything above works with Podman; `podman` is a drop-in for `docker`, and `podman compose` for `docker compose`. Two things to know:

- **Rootless Podman and the bundled database.** The default image initialises its PostgreSQL cluster inside a named volume as root *within the container's user namespace*, so rootless Podman handles it. Bind-mounting a host path over `/var/lib/postgresql/data` will not work, exactly as with rootless Docker. Use a named volume, or prefer the slim image with a separate database container, which side-steps the question entirely.
- **SELinux.** On Fedora, RHEL, and derivatives, add `:Z` to bind mounts so they are relabelled: `-v ./data:/app/data:Z`. Named volumes need no such flag.

```bash
podman compose -f docker-compose.with-postgres.yml up -d
```

To run it as a system service, generate a systemd unit from the running containers:

```bash
podman generate systemd --new --name tymeslot > ~/.config/systemd/user/tymeslot.service
systemctl --user enable --now tymeslot
```

### Optional Environment Variables

> The complete, annotated list of every supported variable lives in [`.env.example`](.env.example) and online at [Environment Variable Reference](https://tymeslot.app/docs/env-reference). The most common knobs are shown below.

```bash
# Application
PORT=4000                    # HTTP port (default: 4000)
DATABASE_URL=                # Full connection string (default: unset; wins over the variables below)
DATABASE_HOST=localhost      # Database host (default: localhost)
DATABASE_PORT=5432          # Database port (default: 5432)
DATABASE_SSL=                # TLS: true / verify-full / verify-none / false (default: unset, no TLS)
DATABASE_SSL_CACERT_FILE=    # CA bundle for certificate verification (default: system trust store)
DATABASE_POOL_SIZE=10        # DB pool size (default: 10)

# HTTP Proxy (for environments with restricted outbound access)
HTTP_PROXY=                  # Proxy for HTTP requests (e.g., http://user:pass@proxy.example.com:3128)
HTTPS_PROXY=                 # Proxy for HTTPS requests (e.g., http://user:pass@proxy.example.com:3128)
NO_PROXY=                    # Bypass proxy for these hosts (e.g., localhost,*.internal.com,10.0.0.0/8)

# OAuth Providers (optional - configure through dashboard after setup)
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
GOOGLE_STATE_SECRET=         # Self-generated random string (required with Google OAuth)
OUTLOOK_CLIENT_ID=           # From Azure AD App Registration (used for both Outlook & Teams)
OUTLOOK_CLIENT_SECRET=       # From Azure AD App Registration (used for both Outlook & Teams)
OUTLOOK_STATE_SECRET=        # Self-generated random string (required with Microsoft OAuth)
ENABLE_GOOGLE_AUTH=false     # Enable Google login/signup
ENABLE_GITHUB_AUTH=false     # Enable GitHub login/signup
```

### Error tracking

Tymeslot records every unexpected error, process crash and failed background job in its own database, with the user id and the request, LiveView or job it happened in (request path, parameters, headers and client IP included; credentials, tokens, cookies and email addresses are redacted first). Nothing leaves your server unless you enable admin alert emails. Records of an error not seen for 30 days are resolved, and deleted 30 days later.

To store nothing, set:

```bash
ERROR_TRACKING_ENABLED=false
```

Errors are then only logged. See the `ERROR TRACKING` section of [`.env.example`](.env.example) for exactly what is kept and for how long.

### Booking Analytics (optional)

Booking analytics — page-view tracking, cookie-less visitor counting, and the
attribution dashboard — is **disabled by default**. Most self-hosters do not
enable it and can ignore this section entirely.

If you opt in (`config :tymeslot, :booking_analytics_enabled, true`), then
`ANALYTICS_SALT_SECRET` becomes **required** and the app will **fail fast at
boot** if it is missing:

```bash
# Required ONLY when booking analytics is enabled.
# Keys the cookie-less daily visitor fingerprint. Generate ONCE with:
#   openssl rand -base64 48
# It must stay constant across deployments — changing it re-hashes the same
# visitor and double-counts uniques.
ANALYTICS_SALT_SECRET=<paste_generated_secret>
```

When analytics is left disabled (the default), this variable is not read and
need not be set.

### Generate Secrets

```bash
# Generate SECRET_KEY_BASE (64+ characters)
openssl rand -base64 64 | tr -d '\n'

# Generate DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY (recommended)
openssl rand -base64 48 | tr -d '\n'

# Generate database password
openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -d '\n'

# Generate OAuth state secrets (for GOOGLE_STATE_SECRET, OUTLOOK_STATE_SECRET, etc.)
# Note: These are self-generated for security, NOT provided by Google/Microsoft
openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -d '\n'
```

## Data-at-rest encryption

Integration credentials (calendar tokens, CalDAV passwords, video API keys, Slack/Telegram
tokens, webhook secrets) are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM.

By default the encryption key is derived from `SECRET_KEY_BASE`. That works, but it welds
your data-at-rest protection to the cookie-signing secret: **rotating `SECRET_KEY_BASE` would
make every stored credential undecryptable**, forcing every user to reconnect every
integration.

Setting a dedicated **`DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY`** decouples the two, so the session secret can be
rotated freely without touching stored data.

### Enabling it on an existing install

1. Generate a key and add it to your `.env` (keep it stable forever — losing it makes stored
   credentials unrecoverable):

   ```bash
   echo "DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 48 | tr -d '\n')" >> .env
   ```

2. Restart so the app starts writing new values under the new key. Existing values keep
   decrypting under the old (`SECRET_KEY_BASE`-derived) key automatically — nothing breaks.

3. Migrate existing rows onto the new key:

   ```bash
   docker exec tymeslot /app/bin/tymeslot eval \
     'Ecto.Migrator.with_repo(Tymeslot.Repo, fn _ -> IO.inspect(Tymeslot.Security.CredentialReencryption.run(), label: "reencryption") end)'
   ```

   Re-run until the reported `migrated_values` is `0` to confirm every credential is on the
   new key. The sweep is idempotent and safe to run repeatedly.

Only after the sweep reports zero migrated values is it safe to rotate `SECRET_KEY_BASE`.

### Rotating the data key in the future

The versioned format is built for rotation, not just the one-time legacy migration above. A new
key gets its own version and coexists with the current one: new writes use the new key, existing
values keep opening under the previous key, and the re-encryption sweep walks the data onto the
new key. Only once the sweep reports zero is the previous key retired. Nothing is ever wiped.

**Do not rotate by simply changing `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to a new value.** Replacing it in place
would strand every credential already written under the old key — the old key would no longer be
in the keyring to decrypt them. True rotation keeps both keys available until the sweep finishes,
which requires a release that registers the additional key. When key rotation is supported, follow
the upgrade notes for that version rather than editing the value by hand.

## Common Commands

```bash
# View logs
docker logs -f tymeslot

# Stop container
docker stop tymeslot

# Start container
docker start tymeslot

# Restart container
docker restart tymeslot

# Remove container
docker stop tymeslot && docker rm tymeslot

```

---

## Updates

### Update to Latest Version

```bash
# Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# Rebuild and restart
./build-docker.sh
```

Or with Docker Compose:

```bash
git pull origin main
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build
```

> **Upgrading an older install — database volume renamed to `tymeslot_pg`.** Earlier versions named the PostgreSQL volume `postgres_data` (build script / manual `docker run`) or `<project>_postgres_data` (Docker Compose). Both now use `tymeslot_pg`. If you started Tymeslot before this change, your existing data is in the old volume — re-point the new mount at it, e.g. `-v postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`, or migrate the data into `tymeslot_pg` once, so the upgrade doesn't start against an empty database.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Container Won't Start

```bash
# Check logs for errors
docker logs tymeslot

# Common causes:
# - Missing or invalid environment variables
# - SECRET_KEY_BASE too short (must be 64+ characters)
# - Port 4000 already in use
# - Insufficient disk space
```

**Verify configuration**:
```bash
source .env
echo "SECRET_KEY_BASE length: ${#SECRET_KEY_BASE}"  # Should be >= 64
echo "PHX_HOST: $PHX_HOST"
echo "POSTGRES_PASSWORD set: $([ -n "$POSTGRES_PASSWORD" ] && echo 'Yes' || echo 'No')"
```

### Container Starts But Can't Access Application

Wait 30-60 seconds for:
- PostgreSQL initialization
- Database migrations
- Phoenix server startup

Check startup progress:
```bash
docker logs -f tymeslot
```

Look for: `Running TymeslotWeb.Endpoint` message.

### Database Issues

```bash
# Check PostgreSQL is running
docker exec -it tymeslot ps aux | grep postgres

# Verify database connection
docker exec -it tymeslot su - postgres -c "psql -U $POSTGRES_USER -d $POSTGRES_DB -c 'SELECT version();'"

# Reset database (WARNING: Destroys all data)
# Stop and remove the container first — the volume can't be removed while in use.
docker rm -f tymeslot
docker volume rm tymeslot_pg
```

### `initdb: could not change permissions of directory … Operation not permitted`

This appears on first start when the PostgreSQL volume lands in the container with ownership we can't reassign — typically on Docker Desktop or rootless Docker when a host path is bind-mounted at `/var/lib/postgresql/data`, or on SELinux-enforcing hosts without a `:z`/`:Z` label.

Fixes, in order of preference:

1. **Use the named volume from the quick-start** (`-v tymeslot_pg:/var/lib/postgresql/data`). Named volumes live inside Docker's own storage and are immune to host filesystem quirks.
2. **If you need the data on a specific host path**, run PostgreSQL in its own container (or managed externally) and point Tymeslot at it — see [Running PostgreSQL as its own container](#running-postgresql-as-its-own-container), which does exactly that with a ready-made Compose file.
3. **If you previously attempted a first run that crashed**, remove the partially-initialised volume before retrying: `docker volume rm tymeslot_pg`.

### Port Already in Use

```bash
# Check what's using port 4000
sudo lsof -i :4000

# Either stop the conflicting service or change PORT in .env
PORT=8080  # Use a different port
```

### OAuth Not Working

- Verify redirect URLs exactly match the ones specified in the OAuth Setup section below
- Check PHX_HOST matches your domain
- Ensure credentials are correctly set in `.env`
- For Microsoft OAuth, ensure both redirect URIs are configured in Azure AD
