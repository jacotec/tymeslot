defmodule Tymeslot.Emails.OrganiserNoteTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The note a host writes when creating a meeting reaches the people they
  invited — the main guest and everyone added beside them.

  It used to be shown only to the organiser, which is right for a note left by
  the person booking and useless for one the host wrote to be read.

  The two are kept apart by *where they live*, not by a flag: the host's note
  is the meeting's own `description`, `attendee_message` is the attendee's own
  words. Deleting a meeting type nils `meeting_type_id` on its bookings, so
  anything deriving authorship from that field would hand a booker's private
  note to every co-guest.
